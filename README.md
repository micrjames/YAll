## General Info
I wrote this as part of working through implementing data structures.

## Technologies Used
I'm only using plain, vanilla Typescript with no libraries or other packages.

## Features

## Setup
Just import the YAll class into your project.

## Usage

## Project Status
As this code is intended to be a part of a project in itself, this project is still in progress and will be until that project is completed. 

## Room for Improvement
The areas where there may be some room for improvement are those where some properties may be better suited to be public and thereby a couple functions should be removed.

## Contact
Feel free to contact me @michaelrjamesjr on twitter.
